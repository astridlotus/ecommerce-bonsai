# Ecommerce Website - Bonsai

Front end code stored in public folder

## Website Description
This is a demonstration ecommerce website for selling bonsai trees which I produced as my final project for my Web Programming class at the University of Washington. I collaborated with Anna Sun. This is my first full stack website! 

Users can be created and are remembered. Existing users can make purchases and review their order history, as well as post reviews for the items as soon as they are "purchased". Most items have limited quantities except for a few which are unlimited. No transaction information is inputted, instead the user simply confirms their password. 

## Technologies Used & Collaboration
I used HTML, CSS, client-side and JavaScript, server-side JavaScript, and a SQL database. I used these technologies because they were the one's I was most familiar with while simultaneously learning SQL basics. 

## Challenges and Features
The biggest challenge for me was creating all of the endpoints for fetching data from my database. In the future I would like to create a better system of confirming a purchase.
